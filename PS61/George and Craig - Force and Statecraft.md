# Force and Statecraft
## Chapter 13
This chapter explores the role of deterrence by analyzing three historical events. Deterrence is
defined as “an effort by one actor to persuade an opponent not to take action of some kind
against his interest by convincing the opponent that the costs and risks of doing so will
outweigh what he hopes to gain thereby.” Assumption: a “rational” opponent -- who can be
expected to calculate the utility of his alternative courses of action on the basis of available
information.

Steps:
1. Find the interests that may be threatened,
2. Convey a commitment to defend those interests,
3. Threaten the opponent based on the credibility and sufficient potence.

__Credibility and sufficient potence.__ From the three cases, George and Craig concluded
that only can credible and sufficiently potent threats back up the deterring commitment. The
word credibility can further be broken down into two parts: a. the will and resolution of the
deterring power and b. the capability for inflicting damage. Sometimes, the force that the
deterring power possesses is “inappropriate or unusable.” Secondly, “is it sufficiently potent to
overcome the opponent’s motivation to change the status quo?” (e.g. the costs of a war and
the enmity of the United States were not sufficient enough to overcome the urge of the Arab
camp to take some drastic action to change the status quo. More important is what the
opponent perceives these factors.

*Whether a given commitment is valid largely depends on how tightly it is connected with the
maker’s national interests.* e.g Other European powers knew that the national interests of
Britain lay in her international trade and her naval supremacy. Thus, conquesting Portugal and
Spanish colonies almost certainly meant to fight with Britain.

*Deterrence is heavily context-dependent.* Johnson was unable to keep up the commitment of
Israel made by Eisenhower because of the Vietnam war. A possible unilateral action was
altered.

*Since #2, it is often difficult to design a strategy that will deter all options available to the
dissatisfied power.* e.g. When the Quadruple Alliance was formed in 1815, the signatories did
not know that the revolutionary France that they wanted to deter would become one of the
most reactionary powers in Europe, suppressing a liberal revolt in Spain; therefore, when such
drastic change happened, the Alliance would have had difficulty deciding the course of action.
At the time the Allies formed, it did not believe that Hitler would desire a total European war.

*Deterrence often fails at stages instead of all at once, and Deterrence is often at best a
time-buying strategy.*



## Chapter 14
This chapter then defines coercive diplomacy and identifies three conditions for coercive
diplomacy to work. Coercive diplomacy employs threats or limited force to persuade an
opponent to call off or undo an encroachment. It is different from deterrence because it aims
at stopping an action that has already been initiated; it is also different from the blunt use of
force in that coercive theory emphasizes the use of threats and "exemplary use of use of
limited force."

There are three conditions necessary of successful employment of this strategy:
1. A sense of urgency for compliance with its demand;
2. A belief that the coercing power is more highly motivated to achieve its stated demand;
3. A fear of unacceptable escalation if the demand is not accepted.

### Ultimatum version
Since coercice diplomacy resembles to the ultimata that were often used in European
diplomacy, the components in an ultimatum play an important role in the other actor's
calculations and behavior. There are three important parts of a full ultimatum:
1. A specific, clear demand on the opponent;
2. A time limit for compliance;
3. A threat of punishment for noncompliance which is credible and sufficiently potnet.

### "try-and-see" approach
Only the first component, a specific and clear demand, is conveyed. It does not impose a time
limit; nor does it attempt to create a strong sense of urgency. The United States used this
limited version to Japan before its attack on Pearl Harbor, attempting to see whether the
threat would be enough to persuade Japan.

This theory is generally more difficult and problematical primarily because it is more context-
dependent. When applying this strategy, the statesman
