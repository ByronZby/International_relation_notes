#  Command of the Commons
## Two potential courses of foreign policy
- primacy: essentially hegemony; to consolidate, exploit, and expand the U.S. relative advantage
after the Cold War by military means

- selective engagement: more sustainable than primacy; more multilateral, liberal, and concerned
with international legitimacy

> The interrelationship between U.S. command of the commons and the persistence of the contested
> zones suggests that the United States can probably pursue a policy of selective engagement but not one
> of primacy.

## Command of the Commons
Commons: include sea, space, and air; areas that belong to no state and that provide access to much of
the globe (Airspace is owned by the country below, but this cannot be easily regulated.)

### The Sources of Command
1. U.S. economic superiority;
2. military exploitation of information technology (development of new weapons, etc.);
3. highly skilled military personnel;

*Command of the Sea*
discusses specific U.S. naval arms (such as submarines and aircraft carriers) and relative superiority to
other states

*Command of Space*
- U.S. spends vast amounts on reconnaissance, navigation, and communications satellites.
- 100 military and 150 commercial satellites in space in 2001
- discusses potential threats to U.S. satellite system

*Command of the Air*
- “The capability for precision attack at great range gives the United States an ability to do significant
damage to the infrastructure and forces of an adversary, while that adversary can do little harm...”

*The Infrastructure of Command*
- U.S. Cold War base structure remains intact; U.S. military bases across the globe strategically important
- Cold War legacy: the Unified Command Plan through which the U.S. military organizes the entire world
for war
- divided into regional commands that engage in regional military diplomacy

### Maintaining Command (at Sea, in Space, of the Air)
- Read first paragraph; good generalization of potential short term, mid-term, and long term threats.
- primarily normative sections giving practical U.S. military advice

## The Contested Zone
- The U.S. has less advantage in enemy-held territory.
- Contested zone: arenas of conventional combat where weak adversaries have a good chance of doing real
damage to U.S. forces
- “Asymmetric” threats: encompass an adversary’s use of weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, or any
mode of conventional warfare that takes into account U.S. strengths

### Limits to Air Power, The Light Infantry Challenge, Littoral Combat
- specific examples of U.S. military shortcomings in certain conditions and how these issues might be
overcome.
- “In short, large numbers of males of military age, favorable terrain, solid training, and plentiful
basic infantry weapons can produce significant challenges for the U.S. military.”
Implications, Implications for Grand Strategy (good idea to read this general wrap-up)
- Selective engagement may sometimes require offensive maneuvers.
- Command of the commons isolates adversary. Command of space allows close study of
adversary. Command of air permits the wearing away of adversary strengths.
- Enduring contested zones mean that allies remain useful, though current U.S. policy tends to undermine
this fact.
- “Selective engagement aims above all to create conditions conducive to great power peace on the
assumption that many other benefits flow from this blessing, the foremost being U.S. security.”
