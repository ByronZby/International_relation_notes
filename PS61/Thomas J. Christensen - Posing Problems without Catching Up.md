# Posing Problems without Catching Up 

This essay is centered on the debate that whether People’s Republic of China would become
a “pear competitor” of the United States and the subsequent situation across the Taiwan
Strait. Christensen argues that 1. China can pose major problems for American security i
nterests (and especially for Taiwan) although 2. the gap between the military capability of the
United States and that of PRC is significantly closing. This is because a. The political
geography of East Asia, b. the domestic politics of mainland China, and c. the perceptual
biases of Chinese elites.

## I. Problems with the peer competitor debate
First, the military power of the United States is spread “thin” in multiple theaters. Two
observations that prove this claim: first, the U.S. force was unrivaled and likely to remain so;
second, during the Gulf War, the United States moved many of its most important logistics
assets out of East Asia. Based on this, the overall assets that the U.S. has is not accurate to
judge whether China perceives itself able to fight against America.

Second, since the United States is very far from all the disputed territories such as Spratly
Islands, it takes time to let the neighbor countries such as Phillipine to respond on behalf of
the United States; it also takes time for the United States to coordinate with Japan. Therefore,
China can have employed its strategies before the United States can respond effectively.
Moreover, Chinese government also attempts to separate the United States from its important
regional allies.

Third, it is invalid to assume that relative material strength means security since a weak
country would not explicitly challenge the interests of a stronger country.  In current power
transition theory, “it is the rising challenger that generally initiates conflict to change the
status quo;” the superior but declining hegemon does not start th e conflict preventively.

In addition, similar to Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, if Chinese leaders are convinced that
a war was inevitable and the first “bold stroke” will drive the United States out of the
peninsula, Chinese might initiate a war.

## II. Reasons why weak China might use force against Taiwan
First, Chinese population may see failure of actions in Taiwan issue as the loss of national
power. If Chinese-Communist Party sees that refraining from force is prohibitively costly to
the regime and that it cares more than Washington does, a war is very likely.

Second, if Chinese government thinks that killing or wounding an American military personnel
could deter American willingness to intervene, it might do so.

Third, if Chinese leaders perceive the U.S. military as sufficiently distracted or tied down in
other parts of the world that the United States could not or would not take on a belligerent
China effect.

Fourth, if Chinese leaders believe that the United States can be separated from its regional
allies by political persuasion or military coercion targeted at those allies.

## III. Potential military strategies that China might adopt
Chinese government might choose to use force, combining old and new technologies,
 coerce Taiwan. Although none of the technologies that PRC processes can, by any means,
occupy Taiwan, they might be used to acheive certain political goals.

Beijing might not be willing to run day-to-day affairs in Taiwan, and what Beijing
desires is the implementation of the agreed One-China Policy. Taiwan need not negotiate the
de facto automacy politically and economically and need not formally declare independence.

The first strategy that China might adopt is to seize the air superiority and threaten the U.S.
Chinese military textbook argues that "a concerted deep strike attck on important enemy
assets can seize battlefiled initiative and establish the conditions for victory" as well as attack
the enemy's psychology and increase our morale. Chinese have drawn this conclusion
primarily based on the recent American military conflicts such as Gulf War and Kosovo war,
during which the United States could have not prevailed if the enemies, such as Baghdad,
had attacked the assets. However, such a logic may not apply if the U.S. assembles forces
in Japan in advance.

The second strategy that the Christensen suggests that Chinese government might adopt is
information and electronic warfare. Accepting PLA's inferiority in overall military capacity,
Wang Houqing and Zhang Xingye, two Chinese strategists, suggest to develop the
capabilities and tactics to weaken the use of high-tech and information-gathering based
weapons used by the advanced forces (Christensen calls it "a counterrevolution in military
affairs") because "[the advanced forces] depend more on more advanced, high-tech systems
than do less advanced countries such as China." Also, Wand and Zhang include the attack on
"the enemy's psychological conviction" as a part of information warfare.

The third strategy is blockade of Taiwan's trade. This can be done by the destruction of ports
and/or deterrence of civilian shipping companies. Since Taiwan's economy highly depends
on China in almost all aspects, such a blockage might be destructive.


## IV. Implications for U.S. national security policy
First, it is helpful to develop military capabilities in order to "blunt" Chinese coercive
capacities without provocative actions such as preemptive attacks and massive destruction
on mainland. Missile defenses can protect American bases.

"Another good investment would be more minesweepers and other mine-clearing assets
stationed in the Seventh Fleet to better counter mainland minewarfare tactics in a timely
fashion without relying on Japan's more extensive mine-clearing assets."

In addition, the U.S. should halt the illusion that Chinese elites may have about American
unwillingness to suffer casualties and pay economic costs in war. It would be helpful if
American officials, scholars, and businesspeople pointed out to their Chinese counterparts
the stark differences between Somalia and China in American strategic think
