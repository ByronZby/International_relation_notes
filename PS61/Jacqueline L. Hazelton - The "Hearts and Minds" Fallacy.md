#  The "Hearts and Minds" Fallacy
In this essay, Hazelton argues that instead of "good governance approach," counterinsurency
can only succeed when elites engage in a contest for power, the government should pay little
attention to polular interests, and the government would benefit from using force against
civilians.

Also, in the introduction Hazelton points out three requirements for a state to defeat
counterinsurgency. First is to accomodate its elite domestic rivals to gain fighting power and
information. Second is to apply force to control civilians and thus reduce the flow of
resources. Ultimately, the third is to break insurgency's will and capacility through "coercive
force."

U.S. efforts to reduce violence by introducing political reforms are unlikely to work; rather,
such efforts will likely to continue to raise human, moral, and financial costs for the U.S. and
its partners.

Success in this essay means, “marginalization of the insurgents to the point at which they are
destroyed, co-opted, or reduced to irrelevance in numbers and capability.”

## Existing explanations for counterinsurgency success
There are two models.

### Good governance model
Hazelton concludes the goal of this model concisely:
> The government must provide political, economic, and social reforms that meet the needs
> of the population; reduce the number and kinds of grievances fueling the insurgency, in an
> effort to obtain information about the insurgency from civilians; and use force against the
> insugency with great care to avoid civilian harm.

Typically, this model means economic growth, political representation, and efficient
administration that addresses popular grievances. This model requires discriminate force that
targets insurgents but prevents harm to civilians. As General petraeus told troops in
Afghanistan, "Only attack insurgents when they get in the way. If we kill civilians or damage
their property ... we will create more enemies than our operations eliminate."

This model has two main problems. 1. it lacks theoretical rigor. Current researchers generally
did not explain under which circumstances what operations work the best. Further,
researchers oftentimes drew conclusions based on unusal cases, lacking "external validity."
2. its assumptions are unexamined. An example would be the assumptions of the role of
reforms: the government has the capability and will to institute them; the populace desires
them; and the majority has no political preferences and will side with the stronger side.
Another example would be that foreign powers could usually decisively shape events. Also,
this model assumes that success requires popular support. (e.g. insurgencies that depends
on selling natural resources like gems and timbers need little popular support to succeed.)

### Forced-based model
There are two schools under this model. One is called guerrilla-centric or enemy-centric
approach; the other is cost-benefit approach.The guerrilla-centric approach suggests that
force is the key to counterinsurgency success prescribing defeating an insurgency militarily.
The cost-benefit approach punishes civilians who do not cooperate and privides benefits for
those who do so, preventing the insurgents to obtain key resources such as food, shelters,
and civilian recruits.

## Coercion theory
